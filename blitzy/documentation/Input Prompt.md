# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Purpose

This document outlines the requirements for a custom-built web application to track data, communication, and notes related to individuals who provide services for the Client. The application will be developed with a structured approach to user management, permissions, customer relationships, equipment tracking, and administrative functionalities.

### 1.2 Scope

The application will facilitate the management of users, customers, contracts, inspectors, and equipment within the Client's ecosystem. The system will be built using VueJS for the frontend and Microsoft ASP.NET Core for backend management.

### 1.3 Data Field Definitions

To ensure consistency and clarity in the implementation, **List Fields** and **Dialog Fields** are defined as follows:

- **List Fields**: These fields must be used to display summarized data in tables or list views when multiple records are presented. The system should ensure these fields provide quick access to essential data points while maintaining a clean and structured layout.
- **Dialog Fields**: These fields must be used in interactive pop-up dialogs or dedicated forms when creating or editing records. The system should enforce structured data input, validation rules, and an intuitive user experience to facilitate seamless data management.

All fields should be implemented according to these guidelines to maintain uniformity across the application.
